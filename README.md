To run this application, unzip seng299-master.zip, and cd to the extracted folder, then run

	$ nodejs server.js
	
You will not need to install modules, as they are already provided. The application can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/

Should the server crash at any point during the testing, simply run nodejs server.js again.
